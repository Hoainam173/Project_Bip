 🛡️ Real-Time Fall Detection System
This project is a real-time fall detection application using the YOLOv8 object detection model, OpenCV, and a Tkinter-based GUI. It aims to detect when a person falls using a webcam and trigger a warning alert.

🚀 Features
Real-time detection with YOLOv8 (yolov8n) for speed and efficiency
Alerts with visual and audio warnings when a fall is detected
Tkinter GUI for simple monitoring
Displays FPS and detection boxes for feedback
Runs on GPU if available for better performance

🧰 Requirements
Make sure to install the following dependencies:
pip install ultralytics opencv-python cvzone pillow pygame torch torchvision torchaudio
You also need to download:
The YOLOv8 model weights: yolov8n.pt (you can get it from Ultralytics)
An alert sound file: alert.wav (place it in the same directory)
🖥️ How to Run
1.Ensure your webcam is connected.
2.Run the script:
python fall_detection.py
3. The GUI will pop up, and the webcam feed will start.
4. When a fall is detected:
A red box and "FALL DETECTED" message appear
An alert sound is played
Status updates in the GUI
🧠 How It Works
The YOLO model detects objects in the frame.
For each detected person, it calculates bounding box dimensions.
If a box is wider than it is tall, it's classified as a potential fall.
A sound is triggered and a visual alert is shown if a fall is detected and not triggered in the last 5 seconds.

📸 Screenshot
(Optional: Add a screenshot of the app GUI with a detected fall here.)

📌 Notes
The model is set to detect only person class with confidence > 80%.
You can improve accuracy by training a custom YOLO model on fall detection datasets.
For low-end systems, reducing frame size or skipping more frames may help.
